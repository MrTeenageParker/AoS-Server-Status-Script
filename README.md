This project is a script that uses the buildandshoot.com server list to provide uptime stats of your server. This only works for the classic versions of AoS, not the new one.

This script is watched but not maintained, so any changes to the buildandshoot API will not be noticed for some time. If you would like to contribute, please keep the same coding style and do not obsfucate in any way.
