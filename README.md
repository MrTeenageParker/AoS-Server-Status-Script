This code can be used for production use. This code can 
be distributed ONLY with this README file. 


Info:
This script can be used in an API if needed, you do not need to use the default template.
This update now supports 0.76, and 0.75.

I updated the HTML in the tutorial as requested to fix deprecated tags.

Change Log:
